            <span class="style1"> This form is used to setup a web service database and identify which services will be queried
            and which layers from that service will be downloaded to the output database (DB). 
            To select a connection and service use the connection and service dropdown 
            controls. Once a connection and service has been specified, a list of available 
            layers will appear in the check listbox. All checked layers for all 
            connections and services will be downloaded
            when the service download button is clicked. When you are finished selecting layers to download simply close this form 
            and use the service download button. Once downloaded, these layers can
            be added to a map using the <img src="../images/cmdAddLayer.gif" alt="Add Feature button" align="middle"/> <span class="style1"> </span><img src="../images/cmdAddRaster.gif" alt="Add Raster button" align="middle"/> buttons. 
            Note: to use this tool you must be connected to the internet.</span>
