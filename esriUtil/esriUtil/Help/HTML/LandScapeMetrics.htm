        <p class="style3">
            There are numerous landscape metrics and software products that 
            calculate landscape metrics. One of the more popular applications that quantify 
            landscape metrics is 
            <a href="http://www.umass.edu/landeco/research/fragstats/fragstats.html">FragStats</a>. 
            For a complete discussion of landscape metrics please download and read the 
            <a href="http://www.umass.edu/landeco/research/fragstats/documents/fragstats_documents.html">FragStats documentation</a>. 
            Our landscape metrics are calculated using focal analysis, a moving windows 
            methodology (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>), and function modeling. Our metrics are calculated at the 
            landscape level and values relate to patch area, edge, area to edge 
            relationships (ratio), and composition. The patch statistics quantified within 
            the analysis window include max, min, sum, mean, mode, median, variance, standard 
            deviation, unique, entropy, and probability (<a href="#F2">Figure 2</a>). Unlike 
            many tools that define unique regions or patches across the landscape, our tool 
            defines a given patch dynamically within the extent of the moving window. This 
            means that a homogenous patch at the edge of a analysis window could potentially 
            be split into multiple patches. Conceptually, one can think of the analysis 
            window as a mini-landscape with the extent defined to capture the naturally 
            occurring process. This provides the focal cell with a unique frame of reference 
            in relationship to the mini-landscape, meaning that the analysis window should 
            be defined in such a manner that it can be justified (e.g., the distance an 
            animal can move, water can travel, and a plant can consume resources, over a 
            specific period of time). The outputs form the analysis consist of function 
            raster datasets that can be used by any of the other RMRS 
            Raster Utility tools.</p>
